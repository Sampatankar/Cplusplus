I wanted to add to my Python & Web Dev skills, and C++ is a great place for me. The initial set up was an education, and the differential analysis of the different compilers from GCC to Clang++ was 'fun'.  Now on the fun stuff, and learning. Learning this after Python 3, is a great compare and contrast.
